Cracking a product-based company like Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, or Atlassian requires a strong foundation in computer science concepts and skills. Here is a general 6-month schedule to prepare for interviews at these companies from the basics:

Month 1-2: Basic Programming Skills

Refresh your knowledge of basic programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, and data types.
Learn a programming language (such as Python or Java) and become proficient in it.
Practice implementing algorithms and data structures, such as sorting algorithms, linked lists, trees, and graphs.
Month 3-4: Advanced Programming Concepts

Learn more advanced algorithms and data structures, such as dynamic programming, binary search, and advanced graph algorithms.
Practice implementing these algorithms and data structures in a programming language of your choice.
Participate in online coding competitions such as Codeforces, CodeChef, or Topcoder to practice problem-solving under time pressure.
Month 5-6: Technical Interview Preparation

Read and practice with interview preparation books such as "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.
Practice solving interview-style problems, particularly those asked by the companies you are targeting.
Participate in mock interviews with friends, family, or other aspiring candidates to practice communication, problem-solving, and whiteboarding skills.
Remember, the above schedule is just a general guideline, and your preparation may vary depending on your current level of knowledge and experience. It's also important to maintain a regular practice schedule and stay motivated throughout the process. Good luck!
